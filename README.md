# Regression Task On Student Performance Dataset (A Practical Dataset)

Regression task - Predict student performance in secondary education (attribute named G3) in Student Performance Dataset.

We have the following Datasets in CSV format and their details in TXT format
# ➢ student.csv - Student Performance Dataset
# ➢ student.txt - Dataset description for student data

# APPLYING LINEAR REGRESSION ON SINGLE FEATURES that is (UNIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION)

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship
between a dependent variable(target variable= Y) and one or more
independent variables(Feature vectors=X). Let X be the independent variable
and Y be the dependent variable. We will define a linear relationship between
these two variables as follows:

# Y = mX+c

Our challenge is to determine the value of m and c, such that the line
corresponding to those values is the best fitting line or gives the minimum
error .

# Firstly I Proposed CLOSED FORM SOLUTION

# Secondly Proposed GRADIENT DESCENT SOLUTION

# Then Lastly Proposed NEWTON'S METHOD SOLUTION

# Then applied MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION that is on MORE THAN ONE FEATURES.

And Then Lastly calculated the Accuracy and all the other Metrics analysis for all of the above solution withe the graph plotting.
